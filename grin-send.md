          To send us GRIN you must generate a <strong>slate transaction</strong> file and upload it to us.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you are using the Grin command-line wallet, you may generate the slate transaction
          using this terminal command:
        </p>

        <pre>./grin --floonet wallet send -m file -d sideshift.txt 1.23</pre>

        <p>
          ...where <strong>1.23</strong> is the number of GRIN to send.
        </p>

        <p>
          The command generates a file <strong>sideshift.txt</strong> which you must upload to
          SideShift AI.
        </p>
