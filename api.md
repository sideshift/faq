# Where is the API?

SideShift AI uses a self-documented GraphQL API.
Go to https://sideshift.ai/graphql and click **Schema** on the right-hand side.
If you do not know how to use GraphQL, you can google "GraphQL" and learn it.

SideShift AI also exposes a ShapeShift.io compatible API. It's identical to the
ShapeShift API the way it was before they added KYC: https://shapeshiftio.docs.apiary.io/#reference/receipt

Their documentation is terrible, but our devs were able to understand it. You can use the
ShapeShift compatible API with the base url: https://sideshift.ai/shapeshift-api/

## When REST API?

If enough TEST PILOTS ask, we will write a REST API. You can upvote this issue on Github
